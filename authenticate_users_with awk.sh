#usually a stored password is made out of 3 parts, the hashing algorithm, the salt and the hash
#the algorithm echo ${PWD_ARRAY[1]} will echo 6, it means SHA512
#the second part is the salt(echo ${PWD_ARRAY[2]}), which is random. but if you provide the same salt and the same password
#to the hashing algorithm, it will create the same hash.
#the third part is the password hash itself, echo ${PWD_ARRAY[3]}

#now we can check if the entered password is the same as the one in /etc/passwd

#for testing purposes, we can quickly do something like, sudo useradd joe
# and to add his password,  "joe:Password1" | sudo chpasswd, to create an user and generate his password
